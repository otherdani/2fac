# Two-Factor Authentication in Python and Google

Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring not only your password but also a second factor of authentication, typically a code sent to your phone or email. This makes it much harder for unauthorized individuals to access your accounts, even if they have your password.

## Setting up 2FA with Google

Google provides a robust 2FA system that integrates seamlessly with various applications and services. Here's how you can implement 2FA with Google:

1. **Enable 2FA for Your Google Account:**
   - Access your Google account settings.
   - Navigate to the "Security" section.
   - Enable two-step verification.

2. **Generate Authentication Codes:**
   - Google offers a dedicated app called "Google Authenticator" available for iOS and Android.
   - After enabling 2FA, Google will provide you with a QR code. Scan this code using the Google Authenticator app to set up your account.

3. **Implement 2FA in Your Python Application:**
   - **Install the `google-auth-oauthlib` library:**
     ```bash
     pip install google-auth-oauthlib
     ```
   - **Obtain Google API Credentials:**
     - Create a Google Cloud project.
     - Enable the "Google Sign-In" API.
     - Create OAuth 2.0 client credentials.

## Implementing 2FA in Python

If you want to implement a custom 2FA system within your Python application, you can use libraries like `pyotp` to generate and verify time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs).
